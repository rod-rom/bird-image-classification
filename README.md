# Bird image classification
___
Dataset taken from Kaggle competition [BIRDS 450 SPECIES- IMAGE CLASSIFICATION](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/100-bird-species)

## About Dataset
Data set of 450 bird species. 70,626 training images, 22500 test images(5 images per species) and 2250 validation images 
(5 images per species). All images are 224 X 224 X 3 color images in jpg format. The training set is not balanced, 
having a varying number of files per species. Images were gathered from internet searches by species name. Each species 
has at least 130 training image files. One significant shortcoming in the data set is the ratio of male species images 
to female species images. About 80% of the images are of the male and 20% of the female. Consequently, the classifier 
may not perform as well on female specie images.
